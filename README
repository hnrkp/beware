  Beware - the Bewator online booking system reversed

Beware is a small twisted project to enable users of the Bewator booking system
to actually use the web infrastructure of that system without using the
provided Java Applet<tm>.

It uses twisted for request engine stuff and Jinja2 for templating.

For now, just run it like this:
 $ python bewator.py <BEWATOR-HOSTNAME>

and it will present a login page at http://localhost:31337/.

<BEWATOR-HOSTNAME> is of course the server which serves the applet/CGI stuff.
