  Beware - the Bewator online booking system reversed

Beware is a small twisted project to enable users of the Bewator booking system
to actually use the web infrastructure of that system without using the
provided Java Applet<tm>.

It uses twisted for request engine stuff and Jinja2 for templating.

FIXME stuff about arguments, how to setup, etc.
